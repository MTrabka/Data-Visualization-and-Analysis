# Data Visualization and Analysis of League of Legends Champions 
## Project overview
### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the characteristics and statistics of champions in League of Legends. By exploring the dataset, I aim to:

* Understand the relationships between champion attributes such as health, mana, and attack damage.
* Compare champions based on their roles, range types, and resource types.
* Identify patterns and trends in champion stats, such as which roles excel in specific attributes or how different tags impact gameplay.
  
This analysis can help players improve their strategies, developers assess game balance, and analysts study the meta-game dynamics.

### Dataset 

The dataset provides detailed information about 167 champions in League of Legends. It includes a variety of attributes, both categorical and numerical, that define each champion's role, playstyle, and performance in the game.
The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle: [League of Legends Champions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cutedango/league-of-legends-champions/data)
